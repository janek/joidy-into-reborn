1. Configure static elements (all of them)
 - remember not to use x-position, but to use keepView instead

 x problem: can't use page range and keepview's offset at the same time.
 o temp solution : changed .left and .right cases of ScrollViewPageConstraintAnimation.swift to align with the button. Make new cases eventually, or find a different solution
^ iPad layout? all iphones? change constraints to right ones

 - camera could use a fade-in, especially if handling iPad

 x font is not exactly right?


2. Configure page 1 elements

3. Configure page 1 animations

___
ANEW

1. Find out how elems are positioned on different screens
2. Make a list of changes to be made
3. Attempt to make global fixes
4. Make individual fixes

5. Update for iOS9



ALL THINGS WRONG:

- iphone 4: make room for all 


- all iPhones: sign-in and login not at sides


- integration



* why is it impossible to refactor cases to a modifier (1 + diff, 1 - diff)? see method signature in RazzleDazzle

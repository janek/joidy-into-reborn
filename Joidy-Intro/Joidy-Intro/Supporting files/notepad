1. Configure static elements (all of them)
 - remember not to use x-position, but to use keepView instead

 x problem: can't use page range and keepview's offset at the same time.
 o temp solution : changed .left and .right cases of ScrollViewPageConstraintAnimation.swift to align with the button. Make new cases eventually, or find a different solution
^ iPad layout? all iphones? change constraints to right ones

 - camera could use a fade-in, especially if handling iPad

 x font is not exactly right?


2. Configure page 1 elements

3. Configure page 1 animations
